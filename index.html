                <p>
                    Welcome to my portfolio! Currently I am enrolled in a full stack web development bootcamp through the University of Wisconsin Madison Extended Campus. I am excited to start my career in web development and am looking forward to learning about back-end technology. 
                    I graduated from UW-Whitewater in 2016 with my BBA in Information Technology and after graduating completed contract work as a Business Analyst and Quality Assurance Analyst. I am now a Buyer at a small computer manufacturer in the Twin Cities area but am looking forward 
                    to my new career path as a developer. My hobbies include golf, snowboarding, weightlifting and (when I buy another bike) riding motorcycles!
